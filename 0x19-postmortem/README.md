Postmortem: Outage in Web Authentication Service

Issue Summary:

Duration:  
- Start: June 8, 2024, 14:45 UTC
- End: June 8, 2024, 15:45 UTC

Impact:  
The web authentication service was down for 60 minutes. Users were unable to log in or access their accounts. Approximately 75% of our user base was affected, leading to a significant disruption in accessing our services.

Root Cause:  
A misconfiguration in the load balancer's routing rules caused all authentication requests to be directed to a non-existent server, leading to a complete failure in handling login attempts.


Timeline:

- 14:45 UTC:  
  The issue was detected through a spike in failed login attempts reported by our monitoring system.

- 14:47 UTC:  
  The on-call engineer received an alert and started investigating the authentication service logs.

- 14:50 UTC:  
  Initial hypothesis was that the authentication service itself was down, leading to a restart of the service.

- 15:00 UTC:  
  After the restart did not resolve the issue, the investigation shifted to the database, suspecting a connection issue.

- 15:10 UTC:  
  Database connections were verified to be normal. The issue was escalated to the network team.

- 15:15 UTC:  
  The network team identified unusual routing errors in the load balancer logs.

- 15:25 UTC:  
  Detailed inspection of the load balancer configuration revealed incorrect routing rules were applied during a recent update.

- 15:30 UTC:  
  The routing rules were corrected, and normal traffic flow to the authentication service was restored.

- 15:45 UTC:  
  Full service was confirmed to be operational. Post-incident monitoring was set up to ensure stability.


Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: 
The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the load balancer. During a routine update intended to improve traffic distribution, an erroneous rule was added that directed all authentication requests to a server that was no longer in service. This caused a bottleneck, as the load balancer attempted to send traffic to a non-existent endpoint, resulting in authentication failures.

Resolution:  
Once the network team identified the routing error, they promptly updated the load balancer configuration to restore the correct routing rules. This involved:
- Removing the incorrect rule that directed traffic to the non-existent server.
- Verifying and reapplying the correct rules to ensure all authentication requests were properly distributed to the active servers.

After these changes, normal service was restored, and additional monitoring was put in place to catch similar issues in the future.



Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements and Fixes:
1. Configuration Management:  
   Enhance the change management process for load balancer configurations to include more rigorous pre-deployment testing and review.

2. Automated Monitoring: 
   Implement more granular monitoring on routing rules and traffic distribution to quickly identify misconfigurations.

3. Alerting Enhancements:  
   Update alerting systems to catch unusual traffic patterns earlier, particularly focusing on login and authentication services.

4. Documentation and Training:  
   Improve documentation on the network team's processes for handling load balancer updates and provide additional training to avoid future misconfigurations.

Tasks:
- [ ] Create a rollback plan for load balancer configurations to quickly revert changes if issues arise.
- [ ] Develop automated tests for load balancer rule changes to validate configurations before deployment.
- [ ] Implement a dashboard to monitor and visualize authentication traffic and routing metrics in real-time.
- [ ] Conduct a review and update the incident response playbook to include steps for validating load balancer configurations.
- [ ] Schedule a training session for the network and DevOps teams on best practices for load balancer management and monitoring.

By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent similar outages and ensure more robust and resilient authentication services.


This postmortem outlines the critical points of the outage and provides a roadmap for improving our systems to prevent future incidents.
